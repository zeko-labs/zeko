# Pausing

To prevent hacks there is a committee of people who can pause the rollup
under certain conditions.
The threshold for this committee is to be on the lenient side, to allow
for lenient pausing in case there is a suspicion that there is an issue.

Unpausing currently happens through the same route as governance/contract upgrading.
